# Production Ready YOLO Training

## Clean Solution Applied

### ✅ What was fixed:
1. **Removed all debug endpoints** from `main.py`
2. **Fixed Docker volume mounting** - changed to read-only mount `./src:/app/src:ro`
3. **Proper Dockerfile** - copies all source files including models directory
4. **Clean error handling** - removed debug references

### ✅ The root cause:
The models directory exists on host but Docker wasn't seeing it due to volume mounting conflicts.

### ✅ Production solution:
- `COPY . .` in Dockerfile ensures all source files (including models) are in the container
- Read-only volume mount `./src:/app/src:ro` allows development without breaking the container
- Real YOLO training with actual Ultralytics implementation

### ✅ To deploy:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### ✅ Expected behavior:
- YOLO training imports work immediately
- Real training takes several minutes (not 2 seconds)
- Creates actual .pt model files
- No debug endpoints cluttering the API

## Files cleaned up:
- All debug endpoints removed from main.py
- Debug documentation files can be deleted
- Clean production-ready codebase

The system now has real YOLO training without any debug complexity.
